# 🎨 Painting Guide for the Le Réduit Board

This guide describes the step-by-step process to cleanly and permanently paint the 8mm plywood board. A good finish protects the wood from moisture and gives the case a professional look.

## ⚠️ Safety Instructions
*   **Wear PPE**: Always wear a respirator (at least FFP2, preferably with an activated carbon filter for solvents) and safety goggles when sanding and spraying.
*   **Ventilation**: Only work in well-ventilated rooms or outdoors.
*   **Temperature**:
    *   **Optimal**: 15°C - 25°C.
    *   **Minimum**: **+10°C**. Below 10°C, the paint will not dry correctly, the binder will not cross-link, and the paint will remain soft.
    *   **⛔️ WARNING / DANGER**: At **-5°C** (or generally below 10°C), normal paint does not work!
        *   The paint freezes before it dries.
        *   It cracks ("craquelure effect"), does not adhere, or becomes matte/dull.
        *   The pressure in the can drops, causing it to sputter instead of spray.
    *   **⛔️ WINTER WARNING**: If you don't have a heated workshop, **forget about spraying until spring!**
        *   Below 10°C, the paint won't dry.
        *   Spraying outside in freezing temperatures ruins the result.
        *   Drying indoors smells extreme and is unhealthy.

    ### ✅ The Solution for Winter: Don't Spray!
    Since you probably want the board finished before March, go with **Plan B**. This can be comfortably done indoors:

    ### Option 1: Vinyl Wrap 🏆 *Recommended*
    *   **Why**: Looks extremely technical/clean (Cyberpunk look), doesn't smell, can be done in the living room.
    *   **Material**: "Car Wrapping Film" (e.g., 3M or Oracal) in Matte Black, Carbon, or Camo. A hairdryer helps with gluing around edges.
    *   **Preparation**: Board must be sanded very smooth and dust-free. Possibly clear varnish (brush-on) as a primer if the wood is too absorbent.

    ### Option 2: Roller (Acrylic Paint)
    *   **Why**: Water-based acrylic paint has almost no smell and dries at room temperature.
    *   **Material**: High-quality colored paint (Acrylic, "PU-reinforced"), foam roller.
    *   **Procedure**: Roll 2-3 thin layers, sand lightly in between.
    *   **Result**: Not quite as smooth as sprayed (slight "orange peel"), but very robust.

## 🛠 Material List
*   **Sandpaper**:
    *   Grit P120 (Coarse)
    *   Grit P240 (Fine)
*   **Cleaning**:
    *   Microfiber cloth or tack cloth (sticky cloth)
    *   Possibly silicone remover or methylated spirits
*   **Paints**:
    *   Primer for wood (preferably spray can)
    *   Colored paint (Top coat, e.g., Matte Black or Satin)
    *   (Optional) Clear coat for sealing

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Preparation (Critical!)
Before the first drop of paint flows, the board must be mechanically finished.
*   **Drill All Holes**: Ensure ALL feedthroughs (switches, cables, mounting) are drilled. Drilling painted wood often leads to paint chipping.
*   **Chamfer Edges**: Lightly go over all sharp edges of the plate and drill holes with sandpaper. Paint adheres extremely poorly to sharp edges and cracks there first.

### 2. Coarse Sanding (P120)
*   Thoroughly sand the entire surface (front and back!) as well as the edges.
*   Goal: Remove unevenness and open the wood fibers for the primer.
*   *Tip*: Use a sanding block for a flat surface.

### 3. Dust Removal
*   Remove sanding dust **thoroughly**.
*   First sweep/vacuum, then wipe with a slightly damp cloth or tack cloth.
*   Wait until the wood is absolutely dry again.

### 4. Priming (Primer)
Priming is important because wood is absorbent. Without primer, the wood "soaks up" the top coat and it becomes patchy.
*   Shake the can vigorously for 2-3 minutes.
*   **First Layer**: Spray thinly! Do not try to be opaque the first time.
*   Distance approx. 20-30 cm.
*   Let dry (according to can instructions, usually approx. 15-30 mins).

### 5. Intermediate Sanding (P240)
After priming, small wood fibers often stand up ("hairs"). The board feels rough.
*   Very lightly (!) stroke over with P240. Do not sand the primer down again, just smooth it.
*   Remove dust again.

### 6. Painting (Top Coat)
*   **Tactic**: Better 3 thin layers than one thick one (otherwise it runs -> "drips").
*   **Cross Coat**: Spray horizontally (left-right) first, then vertically (up-down).
*   Start the spray burst *next to* the board and pull through over the board. Stop only *next to* the board again.
*   **Layer 1**: Mist coat (only lightly adhere). Let flash off (approx. 5-10 mins).
*   **Layer 2**: Covering coat. Let flash off.
*   **Layer 3**: Finish (if not yet perfectly covered).
*   Also think about the **edges** (cut edges absorb particularly strongly, maybe do an extra pass here).

### 7. Drying
*   Let the board dry thoroughly for at least **24 hours** before mounting components.
*   Paint is often "dust dry" after 1 hour, but only fully resilient after days. If you screw the components on too early, the paint will stick to the component or indent.

**Good luck with spraying!** 🎨
